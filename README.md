Gunslingers: A Game for Several Players
=======================================

A year ago,
Nugget City was nothing more than a dusty railroad siding,
but then Moses McNab found gold in the nearby hills.
Nugget City is now a sprawling, lawless frontier town,
and your goal is to become its first mayor.
To do that,
you'll have to impress, bribe, or intimidate the townsfolk,
and eliminate your competition.

Definitions
-----------

* regular die: rolls 1-6

* counting die: 1-3 count as 0, 4-5 count as 1, 6 counts as 2

* property rating: how much money is collected from each property
  a player controls each week.  This can be a constant, the sum
  of several counting dice rolls, or a mix of the two.

Characters
----------

Each of the players is one of these characters:

* Mrs. Parlor: runs the local whorehouse
* Colonel Cartwright: owner of Nugget City's best stable
* Harvey "Heavy" Harrigan: owns the general store
* Anton Boozer: proprietor of Nugget City's largest saloon
* Silas Neat: the town's undertaker

If a player ever loses their headquarters, they are out of the game.
(Any of their gang who are still loyal to them leave town.)

Winning
-------

The game starts eight weeks before the election.
On voting day,
the player with the highest total of reputation (used to impress citizens),
cash (used to bribe them),
and gunslingers (used to intimidate them)
is the winner.

Board
-----

The board consists of 20 properties arranged as shown below:

        O O O
    O O O T O O O
    O O O O O O O
        O O O

The train station is in the center of town; all the other properties
are laid out at random at the start of each game.

Turns
-----

Each turn represents a week,
and is broken up into the following rounds:

* New gunslingers arrive by train.
* First round of taking territory.
* Second round of taking territory.
* Rents are collected.

Setup
-----

Players select their character at random
(variant: allow players to bid for characters?).

All players place their headquarters marker in the property that
corresponds to their character.
They collect initial money
and reputation tokens
corresponding to their character card.
Players also take one set of cards,
each card corresponding to one property in the game,
plus three decoy (blank) cards.

Next, players prepare initial properties to bid on
and initial batches of gunslingers.
Reveal a number of property cards equal to the number of players.
Then, prepare a number of gunslinger groups equal 
to the number of players.
For each batch of gunslingers,
roll 6C to determine how many gunslingers are in the batch.
Roll 1C for each gunslinger to determine their skill:

* 1-3: plug (ordinary)
* 4-5: enforcer
* 6: duellist

Players then bid on these properties and gunslinger batches,
using their initial money. 
Randomly determine a starting player.
The starting player selects one item to bid on
(either a property card or a gunslinger batch).
Every player then puts coins in their hands
and reveal them simultaneously.
Whoever has made the highest bid wins.

Players are allowed to bid nothing.
If every player bids nothing,
the property card or gunslinger batch cannot be auctioned again.

If two or more players are tied for the highest bid,
whoever among them with the greatest number of reputation tokens wins the tie.
If two or more players are still tied,
everyone else drops out and they re-bid.
They must either bid more than they bid on the previous round,
or bid nothing at all.
(Again,
if all players bid nothing,
the auction item is lost.)
This continues until the auction has a winner or the auction item is lost.

If the player who selected the auction item won the auction,
the next player clockwise selects the next auction item.
Otherwise,
the player who selected the last auction item selects another one.

Every item must be put to auction once.

When a player wins a property auction,
they put one of their tokens in the property card on the board.
They also take the reputation tokens that the card provides to its owner,
if any.

When a player wins a gunslinger batch,
they put the corresponding gunslingers in their headquarters.

Once all items have been auctioned,
play starts with the first Train phase.

The Train
---------

Roll 3C to determine how many gunslingers the train brings to town.
Once the number has been determined,
roll 1C for each gunslinger to determine their skill
(see the skill table on the Setup section)

Players then bid for the gunslingers' services.
They must bid for the entire group at once --- they cannot pick and choose individuals.
To bid,
they follow the same process used in the setup auction bids.

However,
if a player controls the train station,
he or she waits until everyone else has revealed their first-round bid,
and then makes his or her bid.
That player bids normally in any subsequent rounds.

Once gunslingers have been hired,
they are moved to their player's headquarters.

Taking Territory
----------------

Players try to take territory from one another twice each turn.
To do this,
they place the card identifying the territory they are trying to take over
face-down in front of them,
and then place one or more of their gunslingers on the card.
Any gunslingers who aren't placed on cards become the player's posse for that turn.

A player can also put a decoy card down and put gunslingers on it to fool opponents.

Whoever controls the newspaper office
can wait until other players have set up their moves,
then look at one face-down card before setting up his or her own moves.

Once all players have set up their moves,
everyone turns over their cards at once.
There are three cases for each territory:

* No-one is trying to claim it:
  the territory stays under the control of whoever previously controlled it (if anyone).

* One player is trying to claim it:
  that player takes control of the territory (explained below).

* Two or more players are trying to claim it:
  gunfight!
  Whoever wins takes control of the territory (explained below).

When someone takes control of a territory,
they remove any control marker(s) currently on it,
then add a single control marker of their own.

If they removed another player's control marker(s),
that player returns the number of reputation tokens corresponding to the
territory to the bank,
and the new controller collects the same number of tokens.

If the loser does not have enough reputation tokens to return,
then she returns all of her reputation tokens.
The winner still takes the full amount of reputation tokens from the bank.

Rent Collection
---------------

Players earn money from all the properties that
they have controlled for an entire week without interruption.
This can be a fixed or variable amount.

* The rent for the photographer's is $3 per week.

* The rent for the whorehouse is one counting dice for each gunslinger in play,
  up to a limit of six counting dice.

* The rent for the blacksmith's shop is $2 per week,
  plus one counting dice for each gunslinger in play
  up to a maximum of 4
  (since the blacksmith can only do so much work per week).

In order to keep track of which territories players have controlled for an entire week,
they put one control marker on a territory when they first take it over,
and add a second marker to the territory at the end of the turn
(after the Rent Collection phase).
They can only collect rents for territories with two markers.

Gunfights
---------

A gunfight may take place
when two or more players have gunslingers on the same territory.
If more than two players are in the gunfight,
two are chosen randomly to fight first.
The survivor then fights the next player (chosen randomly),
and so on.

At the start of each fight,
each player puts a marker in their fist if they want to fight,
and leaves it empty if they want to back down.
All players reveal their markers simultaneously:

* If one player backs down, he or she loses a point of reputation.

* If both players back down, each one loses two points of reputation.

Each time a player loses reputation in this way,
they check whether they have enough reputation tokens to "hold"
all their properties.
If they do not,
they must relinquish control of one territory chosen randomly
(by shuffling territory cards and choosing one)
*or* immediately lose one of their strongest gunslingers
(who leaves town in disgust).

The gunfight then proceeds in rounds.
In each round,
all the duellists shoot first (and simultaneously),
followed by the enforcers,
followed by the plugs.
To shoot,
the player identifies a target and rolls 1, 2, or 3 regular dice
depending on whether the shooter is a plug, a enforcer, or a duellist.
If any of the dice show a 6,
the target has been hit.

The player who owns the gunslinger then rolls a counting die
to determine if they have been winged (1-3),
wounded (4-5),
or killed (6).
A gunslinger who has been winged misses their next turn to shoot.
One who has been wounded is out of action for the remainder of that gunfight,
and one who has been killed is removed from play.

* Gunslingers who have been winged or wounded can still be targets in
  a gunfight.

* If a wounded gunslinger is wounded a second time, they are dead.

Between rounds,
each player puts a marker in their fist
to show whether they want to stay in the fight or run away.

* If a player runs away before any of their gunslingers are wounded or killed,
  they lose a point of reputation.

* If one player runs away and the other doesn't,
  the one who didn't gets to shoot at the one running away one more time.

Posse
-----

On each territory round,
a player may keep some gunslingers in reserve as a posse
rather than trying to use them to take territory.
After all gunfights for a round have finished,
players can use their posse
to try to take back one territory that they have just lost.
Each player puts a territory card or decoy card face-down as usual
and adds their posse to it.
Players turn their cards over simultaneously,
and any resulting gunfights proceed as above.

What Needs to Be Done
---------------------

* How are points calculated for cash, reputation, and gunslingers
  to determine victory?

* Players should be able to bribe enemy gunslingers,
  either to get them to throw a fight or to change sides entirely.

* Other territories should have special properties
  like the train station and the newspaper office.

* Each player should have a special power as well.

* The sheriff should be either
  a non-player character who arrests people when gunfights get out of hand (if he's honest),
  or just another territory with some special power (if he's corruptible).

* There should be "neighborhoods",
  i.e.,
  it should be risky for someone to try to take over a territory
  that's a long way away from anywhere they currently control.
  This would discourage people from
  trying first-round all-out assaults on opponents' headquarters.

* The gunfight mechanics need to be simpler.
