Gunslingers: A Game for 2-5 players
===================================

A year ago, Nugget City was nothing more than a dusty railroad siding,
but that was before Moses McNab found gold in the nearby hills.
Nugget City is now a sprawling, lawless frontier town.  Your goal is
to become its first mayor.  To do that, you'll have to eliminate the
competition.

Definitions
-----------

* regular die: rolls 1-6

* counting die: 1-3 count as 0, 4-5 count as 1, 6 counts as 2

* property rating: how much money is collected from each property
  a player controls each week.  This can be a constant, the sum
  of several counting dice rolls, or a mix of the two.

Characters
----------

Each of the players is one of these characters:

* Mrs. Parlor: runs the local whorehouse
* Harvey "Heavy" Harrigan: owns the general store
* Colonel Cartwright: a local rancher
* Anton Boozer: proprietor of Nugget City's largest saloon
* Amos Neat: the town's undertaker

If a player ever loses their headquarters, they are out of the game.
(Any of their gang who are still loyal to them leave town.)  The game
is over when only one player remains.

Board
-----

The board consists of 20 properties arranged as shown below:

        O O O
    O O O T O O O
    O O O U O O O
        O O O

The train station and the undertaker's are opposite each other in the
center of town; all the other properties are laid out at random at the
start of each game.

Turns
-----

Each round represents a week.  Each turn is a day, with Monday being
the first turn of each round.  Special events occur before regular
play on each turn as follows:

<table>
  <tr><td>Monday</td><td>---</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>east-bound train</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>---</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Thursday</td><td>----</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Friday</td><td>west-bound train</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Saturday</td><td>rent collection</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sunday</td><td>day of rest (i.e., no regular play)</td></tr>
</table>

The special events work as follows:

* Rent collection: players earn money from all the properties they
  have controlled for that entire week without interruption.

  Example: the rent for the photographer's is $3 per week.

  Example: the rent for the whorehouse is two counting dice (2C) for
  each gunslinger in play, with no limit.

  Example: the rent for the blacksmith's shop is $2 per week, plus 1C
  for each gunslinger in play up to a maximum of 12 (since the
  blacksmith can only do so much work per week).

* East-bound train: roll 1C to determine how many gunslingers each
  train brings to town.

* West-bound train: roll 3C to determine how many gunslingers each
  train brings to town.  (More gunslingers are headed west than east,
  not least because of the high mortality rate in towns like Nugget
  City.)

Once the number of gunslingers arriving on a particular train has been
determined, roll 1C for each gunslinger to determine their skill:

<table>
  <tr><td>1-3</td><td>plug (ordinary)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4-5</td><td>enforcer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>duellist</td></tr>
</table>

Players then bid for the gunslingers' services.  They must bid for the
entire group at once --- they cannot pick and choose individuals.  To
bid, players put coins or other markers in their hands, then reveal
them simultaneously.  Whoever has made the highest bid wins.

* Players are allowed to bid nothing.  If every player bids nothing,
  the gunslingers get back on the train.

* If two or more players are tied for the highest bid, everyone else
  drops out and they re-bid.  They must either bid more than they bid
  on the previous round, or nothing at all.  Again, if all players
  bid nothing, the gunslingers get back on the train.

* If a player controls the train station, he or she waits until
  everyone else has made their first-round bid, and then makes his or
  her bid.  That player bids normally in any subsequent rounds.

Once gunslingers have been hired, they are moved to their player's
headquarters.

Taking Territory
----------------

In the regular play portion of each turn, players try to take
territory from one another.  To do this, they place the card
identifying the territory they are going to try to take over face-down
in front of them, and then place one or more of their gunslingers on
the card.  Any gunslingers who aren't placed on cards become the
player's posse for that turn.

* Each of territory is identified with a symbol from a regular deck of
  cards, e.g., the blacksmith's shop is 2-Spades.  The face cards
  aren't used to identify territories, so they can be used as decoys
  (i.e., a player can put a face card down and put gunslingers on it
  to fool opponents).

* Whoever controls the newspaper office can wait until other players
  have set up their moves, then look at one face-down card before
  setting up his or her own moves.

Once all players have set up their moves, everyone turns over their
cards at once.  There are three cases for each territory:

* No-one is trying to claim it: the territory stays under the control
  of whoever previously controlled it (if anyone).

* One player is trying to claim it: that player takes control of the
  territory (explained below).

* Two or more players are trying to claim it: gunfight!  Whoever wins
  takes control of the territory (explained below).

When someone takes control of a territory, they remove any control
marker currently on it, then add a single control marker of their own.
On Sunday (the day of rest), players add a second control marker to
each territory they control.  They can only collect rent on Saturday
from territories that still have two of their control markers, i.e.,
territories they have controlled for the entire week without
interruption.

Gunfights
---------

When two or more players have gunslingers on the same territory, a
gunfight may take place.  If more than two players are still in the
gunfight, two are chosen randomly to fight first.  The survivor then
fights the next player (chosen randomly), and so on.

At the start of each fight, each player puts a marker in their fist if
they want to fight, and leaves it empty if they want to back down.
All players reveal their markers simultaneously:

* If one player backs down, he or she loses reputation once.

* If both players back down, each one loses reputation twice.

Each time a player loses reputation, they must relinquish control of
one territory chosen randomly (by shuffling territory cards and
choosing one) *or* immediately lose one of their strongest
gunslingers.

The gunfight then proceeds in rounds.  In each round, all the
duellists shoot first (and simultaneously), followed by the enforcers,
followed by the plugs.  To shoot, the player identifies a target and
rolls 1, 2, or 3 regular dice depending on whether the shooter is a
plug, a enforcer, or a duellist.  If any of the dice show a 6, the
target has been hit.

The player who owns the gunslinger then rolls a counting die to
determine if they have been winged (1-3), wounded (4-5), or killed
(6). A gunslinger who has been winged misses their next turn to
shoot. One who has been wounded is out of action for the remainder of
that gunfight, and one who has been killed is, well, killed.

* Gunslingers who have been winged or wounded can still be targets in
  a gunfight.

* If a wounded gunslinger is wounded a second time, they are dead.

Between rounds, each player puts a marker in their fist to show
whether they want to stay in the fight or run away.

* If a player runs away before any of their gunslingers are wounded or
  killed, they lose reputation.

* If one player runs away and the other doesn't, the one who didn't
  gets to shoot at the one running away one more time.

Posse
-----

On each turn, a player may keep some gunslingers in reserve as a posse
rather than trying to use them to take territory.  After all gunfights
for a turn have finished, players can use their posse to try to take
back one territory that they have just lost.  Each player puts a
territory card or decoy card face-down as usual and adds their posse
to it.  Players turn their cards over simultaneously, and any
resulting gunfights proceed as above.

What Needs to Be Done
---------------------

* "Reputation" has been tacked on as a way of adding an element of
  strategy to gunfights, but it should actually be a core part of
  the game.  After a fixed number of weeks (four?), there's an
  election, and a player's chances of winning depend on their
  reputation, their money (for bribes), and how many gunslingers
  they have (for intimidation).

* I've always hated games in which one or two people are knocked out
  early and have to sit around and wait for everyone else to finish
  things off before they can play again.  Instead, we should allow
  players who have been knocked out to make a comeback, either by
  buying their way back into the game after a certain number of turns,
  or by taking over from another player when their reputation drops
  (modeling a coup in that player's gang), or by leading a revolt
  within another player's gang (possibly by bribery) to take some
  of that player's gunslingers away from them.

* Your reputation should have consequences on recruitment. A fraction
  of your reputation points get added to your bid, for instance, or
  reputation is a bid tie-breaker. Reputation can take a hit if you
  attack on a Sunday.

* Players should be able to bribe enemy gunslingers, either to get
  them to throw a fight or to change sides entirely.

* Other territories should have special properties like the train
  station and the newspaper office.

* Each player should have a special power as well.

* The sheriff should be either a non-player character who arrests
  people when gunfights get out of hand (if he's honest), or just
  another territory with some special power (if he's corruptible).

* There should be property damage (i.e., fires) that's very expensive
  to fix, but which costs a lot of reputation.

* There should be "neighborhoods", i.e., it should be risky for
  someone to try to take over a territory that's a long way away from
  anywhere they currently control.  This would discourage people from
  trying first-round all-out assaults on opponents' headquarters in
  two-player games.  One possibility: if you are in a gunfight, add 1
  regular dice on every shooting roll for every building you control
  that is adjacent to the battleground. No diagonal adjacency. This
  bonus only kicks in for buildings you've controlled before this
  round---that is, no chaining.

* People should be able to launch a sneak attack on the day of rest,
  but it should cost them somehow (e.g., make their gunslingers likely
  to quit in disgust, or easier to bribe).
